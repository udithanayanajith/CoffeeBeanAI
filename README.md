# CoffeeBeanAI

A comprehensive machine learning system for coffee bean analysis, featuring both image classification and tabular data prediction capabilities.

- Image classification to verify coffee beans and identify bean types
- Predictive modeling for coffee bean defects and quality assessment
- REST API endpoints for both image-based and data-based predictions

## Features

### Image Classification

- Verify if an image contains coffee beans
- Classify the type of coffee bean
- Confidence scores for predictions

### Tabular Data Prediction

- Predict bean quality based on symptoms and conditions
- Identify potential defects and their causes
- Probability scores for each prediction

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

        git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CoffeeBeanAI.git
        cd CoffeeBeanAI

2.  Install dependencies:

        pip install -r requirements.txt

3.  Download the pre-trained models and place them in the appropriate directories

## Usage

### Running the API

    python app.py
